## Group work
I completed the task for this assignment alone without a group. Therefore, there is not much to say about the teamwork for this project.

## Additional feature
For the additional feature a progress indicator was added. The progress indicator display the current question of the total amount of questions in the questionset. Typically used on webpages, such as newspaper or photo galleries. By adding a progress indicator the user knows their progress throughout the quiz. The see both their current question number and the total amout of question to answer. 

### Advantages
1. The user gets **visual feedback**, which provides a clear, visual indication of how far the user have progressed, allowing them to understand how much of the quiz is left. 
2. Completing a progress indicator can give the user a small, rewarding a sense of **achievement**.
3. Without a progress indicator, users might feel lost or unsure how long the quiz will take. A progress bar **reduces this uncertainty**.
4. **UX-standards** includes that modern apps and websites use progress indicators, so users are accustomed to them.
